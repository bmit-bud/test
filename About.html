	<p class="sourcesans maintxt">This is the personal website of <span class="txt-accent">Your Name</span> and below you can read how it all began<br><br>On my second day at Espas, the 
	<span class="txt-accent">19th of April 2017.</span> I was Tasked with building my own Website. So i started with the html template and CSS font families that i had used a couple times before on other small projects.
	<br><br>Continuing work on the site, i often thought of something that i wanted to do, like a fullscreen background image or a footer that stays at the bottom of the page.
	After googling how to do such things, i added them to my site. Because of that, the original html file with its integrated CSS grew quickly into something that i would classify as "a big mess" I also had to have 
	multiple pages, so i split it up into <span class="txt-accent">index.html</span> and <span class="txt-accent">style.css</span> so the CSS file could evolve by itself into something i could safely consider to be 
	an even bigger mess. <br><br>After the split, the site could grow efficiently with one shared CSS file to handle the stuff that is the same everywhere. This "about" and a "contact" page were added, being the first to use 
	the external CSS. Also a ton of HTTP error code pages were added and littered with easter eggs. Among those pages was everything from the well known <span class="txt-accent">404 -file not found</span> 
	to rather specific stuff like <span class="txt-accent">414 -Request URL Too Long</span> or <span class="txt-accent">451 - Unavailable For Legal Reasons</span><br><br> After that, there were some design-changes:
	a blur effect on the background image or some text shadowing. Also the Navbar got slightly brighter. Speaking of design, an instagram page was also added and filled with embedded posts. <br><br> After that, i reworked the footer
	which was originally made with <span class="txt-accent txt-code">&lt;h6&gt;</span> but that made no sense as it is a footer and not a heading. So i had to redo the formatting the <strong>proper</strong> way, with font sizes and such.
	also the <span class="txt-accent txt-code">&lt;center&gt;</span> i originally used was deprecated so i had to replace it with some CSS: <span class="txt-code txt-accent">text-align: center; </span>
